        <p>Beyond a typical gym, Lifetime Fitness serves as a facility to relax and unwind, offering luxury tools and carefully planned methods to assist with health and wellness. Life Time has broad facilities in the US and Canada which offer services ranging from steam and sauna to specialized caf√©s, 
           swimming pools, and group fitness training. A part from personal training and gyming, many locations offer sports courts, spas, childcare, and recovery lounges making it quite convenient for families to focus on fitness and health. Life Time Fitness does the opposite of traditional fitness clubs by incorporating a 
           community-focused approach enabling comfort and style to achieve health goals.</p>
